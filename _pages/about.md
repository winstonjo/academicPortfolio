# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Winston Jo.

ðŸŽ“ Bachelor in Computer Science
I am graduating this Fall with a degree in Computer Science, where I have developed a strong foundation in software development, algorithms, and data structures. My academic journey fueled my passion for technology and solidified my path as a programmer.

ðŸ’» Programming Enthusiast
Coding isn't just a job for meâ€”it's a passion. I love exploring different languages, frameworks, and tools to solve complex problems and bring creative ideas to life. Whether it's building a robust backend or designing an intuitive frontend, I'm always up for a challenge.

ðŸ“Š Data Science Aficionado
Data is the new oil, and I enjoy digging deep into datasets to uncover patterns, insights, and opportunities. From data cleaning and analysis to building predictive models, I thrive on turning raw data into actionable knowledge.

ðŸŽ¨ Front-End Development Lover
Creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces is something I take pride in. With React as my go-to library, I focus on crafting responsive, dynamic, and accessible web applications that offer seamless user experiences.

âš½ Avid Soccer Enthusiast
When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me watching a match supporting Manchester United. ðŸ˜ˆ
Soccer is my favorite way to unwind, stay active, and connect with friends.

I'm always eager to collaborate on exciting projects and learn new things. Let's build something amazing together! ðŸ˜Š
